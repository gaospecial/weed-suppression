To enable reproducible study, we provided the raw-data and source codes for analysis and generating figures.

# Data processsing

Raw data were stored in the `data` folder. It mainly comes from two experiments: one from growth room study, and the other is field experiment. The raw data is provided as in formatted form.

```{r}
weed_suppression <- read_csv("data/weed suppression.csv")
wheat_promotion <- read_csv("data/wheat promotion.csv")
weed_infestation <- read_csv("data/weed infestation.csv")
infested_wheat <- read_csv("data/infested wheat.csv")
head(weed_suppression) # suppress weed growth by herbicide and SynComs
head(wheat_promotion) # SynComs promote wheat growth 
head(weed_infestation) # field trail of weed suppression
head(infested_wheat) # field trail of wheat promotion
```

The columns are:

-   `herbicide_dose`: herbicide_doses, indicating the name of two different chemical herbicides (Atlantis and Axial) at 25 and 50% of recommended doses: i.e. "Herbicide control", "Atlantis 25%", "Atlantis 50%", "Axial 25%", "Axial 50%".

-   `Inoculation`: Inoculation indicating the combinations of four different Pseudomonas strains (B11, T19, T24, T75) collected from Soil microbiology biochemistry laboratory, University of Agriculture Faisalabad. "C1", "C2", "C3", "C4" represent the Pseudomonas strain combinations such as C1 (B11 x T75), C2 (T19 x T24), C3 (B11 x T24 x T75) and C4 (B11 x T19 x T24 x T75).

-   `treatments`: Under field condition nine treatments were planned in block plot for both weed infestation and infested wheat with weedy and wheat free control respectively, in order to evaluate the selected C4 combination along with Axial herbicide at four different recommended doses such as: 25, 50, 75, and 100% Axial with respective control treatments.   

# Distribution of values

`weed_suppression` indicates the effect of SynComs and herbicides on the growth and physiology of *P. minor* under axenic condition. Nine parameters were obtained. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,3))

hist(weed_suppression$seed_germination, main = "Seed germination")
hist(weed_suppression$SPAD_value, main = "SPAD value")
hist(weed_suppression$plant_height, main = "Plant height")
hist(weed_suppression$root_length, main = "Root length")
hist(weed_suppression$fresh_biomass, main = "Fresh biomass")
hist(weed_suppression$protein, main = "Protein")
hist(weed_suppression$chlorophyll_a, main = "Chlorophyll A")
hist(weed_suppression$chlorophyll_b, main = "Chlorophyll B")

# A new graph

Disign a graph to show the results more clearly. This plot has three parts. 

1. boxplot shows the value of data, and statistical results of comparision;
2. a dotplot shows the dose of herbicide;
3. another dotplot shows the applying inoculation.

* **seed germination rate of weed**

The less of seed germination rate of weed, the better of the suppression of a recipe.

```{r}
df = weed_suppression %>% 
  mutate(herbicide_dose = fct_rev(as_factor(herbicide_dose)),
         Inoculation = fct_rev(as_factor(Inoculation))) %>% 
  group_by(herbicide_dose, Inoculation) %>% 
  mutate(group = factor(cur_group_id()), .before = 3)

df$group = fct_reorder(df$group, df$seed_germination)
 symnum.args<-list(cutpoints= c(0, 0.01, 0.05, Inf),
                            symbols = c("**","*","ns"))

# find the group id by groups
groups = distinct(df, herbicide_dose, Inoculation, group) %>% 
  filter(herbicide_dose == "Herbicide control", Inoculation == "Control") 
ref_group = groups$group %>% as.character()

# boxplot
p1 = df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, seed_germination)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  stat_compare_means(ref.group = ref_group,
                     method = "t.test",
                     hide.ns = FALSE,
                     label = "p.signif",
                     symnum.args = symnum.args) +
  # geom_jitter(width = 0.01) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())

# the herbicide dose
p2 = df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, herbicide_dose)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 15) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        plot.margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0, unit = "pt"))

# the inoculation
p3 = df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, Inoculation)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 15) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        plot.margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0, unit = "pt"))
aplot::plot_list(p1,p2,p3, ncol = 1, heights = c(1,.2,.2))
```

Control is located on the most right side, so that all the combinations of herbicide and SynComs have better effect in suppressing weed seed germination. Among them, who have the best performance are Axial 25%-50% plus C1/C3/C4.  

Now, every parameter can generate a similar plot.

# Weed control by using the combination of herbicides and synthetic community

Firstly, we investigated the influence of AB combinations and chemical herbicides on *P. minor* growth and phenological parameter reduction. The experiments were carried out in green house, and only weed were planted.


## Weed growth

### Seed germination

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "seed_germination")
```

### Plant height

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "plant_height")
```

### Root length

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "root_length")
```

### Fresh biomass

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "fresh_biomass")
```

### Protein content

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "protein")
```

## Weed pigments

Plants contain several different pigments, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, and flavonoids. Chlorophylls are the primary pigments responsible for the green color of plants and are essential for photosynthesis. Carotenoids, which include beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin, are responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors of many fruits and vegetables, and also serve as antioxidants. Flavonoids, which include anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavones, are responsible for the red, blue, and purple colors of many fruits and flowers, and also play a role in plant defense against environmental stresses.

### SPAD value of weed

SPAD value is a measure provided by the SPAD-502Plus, which is a portable, non-destructive measuring device for the chlorophyll content of leaves.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Product of SPAD-502+"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://vnote-1251564393.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/20230326110719.png")
```


```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "SPAD_value")
```

### Chlorophyll A

There are several types of chlorophyll, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c, chlorophyll d, and chlorophyll e, each with their own unique molecular structure and light absorption properties. Chlorophyll is responsible for giving plants their green color, and it is also used as a natural food coloring agent and in some medicinal and industrial applications.

Chlorophyll a is the primary pigment involved in photosynthesis and is found in all photosynthetic organisms, including plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It absorbs light most efficiently at wavelengths of 430-660 nm (blue and red light), and it plays a critical role in the initial stages of photosynthesis by absorbing light and passing on the energy to other molecules.

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "chlorophyll_a")
```


### Chlorophll B

Chlorophyll b, on the other hand, is an accessory pigment that is found only in higher plants and green algae. It absorbs light most efficiently at wavelengths of 450-650 nm (blue and orange light) and transfers this energy to chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll b also helps to broaden the spectrum of light that can be absorbed by the plant, allowing it to capture more energy from the sun and carry out photosynthesis more efficiently.

```{r}
plot_recipe_effect(df, value = "chlorophyll_b")
```

### Caroteniod

Carotenoids are a group of natural pigments that are found in many plants, algae, and some bacteria. They are responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors of many fruits and vegetables, as well as the bright colors of many flowers. Carotenoids are important antioxidants that help protect plants and other organisms from damage caused by harmful molecules known as free radicals. In addition to their role in providing color to plants and other organisms, carotenoids also have important health benefits for humans, including promoting eye health, supporting the immune system, and reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases. Some common carotenoids include beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.

In subsequent comparisons, we aimed to analysis whether the presence of C4 can enhance the ability to a herbicide Axial.

> Axial is a brand name of a herbicide produced by the company BASF. The active ingredient in Axial is pinoxaden, which is a selective herbicide used to control grass weeds in a variety of crops, including cereals, rice, and grass seed crops. Axial works by inhibiting the growth of the targeted grass weeds, which eventually leads to their death. It is typically applied to crops as a post-emergence herbicide, meaning it is sprayed directly onto the weeds after they have emerged from the soil. As with all herbicides, it is important to follow the label instructions carefully and use Axial only as directed to ensure effective control of weeds and to minimize any potential risks to humans, animals, and the environment.

Before start, we edited the treatments and added a new column `has_c4` in this data frame. The reason to do this is that we know that the using of herbicide and C4 can suppress weed growth significantly. Now that the question is whether C4 can play an important role.

```{r}
weed_infestation %<>% 
  mutate(has_c4 = as_factor(if_else(str_detect(treatments, "c4"), "with C4", "without C4"))) %>% 
  mutate(treatments = factor(
    treatments,
    levels = c("weedy control", 
               "wheat+weed 100% axial control", 
               "wheat+weed 100% axial control+c4 inoculation", 
               "wheat+weed 75% axial control", 
               "wheat+weed  75% axial control+c4 inoculation", 
               "wheat+weed 50% axial control", 
               "wheat+weed 50% axial control+c4 inoculation", 
               "wheat+weed 25% axial control", 
               "wheat+weed 25% axial control+c4 inoculation"),
    labels = c("wild", 
               "100% Axial", 
               "100% Axial", 
               "75% Axial", 
               "75% Axial",
               "50% Axial", 
               "50% Axial", 
               "25% Axial", 
               "25% Axial")))
```

**Question**:

- Is the grain yield in this data frame from weed or wheat?

```{r}
cols <- setdiff(names(weed_infestation),c('treatments',"has_c4"))

y_labels <- c("weed density m-2",
              "no of weeds (%)", 
              "shoot length (cm)",
              "SPAD value",
              "grain yield (t ha-1)",
              "straw yield (t ha-1)",
              "photosynthetic rate (µmol m-2 s-1) ",
              "transpiration rate (µmol m-2 s-1)",
              "stomatal conductance (mmol m-2 s-1)")

my_plots = Map(function(x, y) {
  ggboxplot(data = weed_infestation, x = "treatments", y = x,
            legend ="none",
            color = "has_c4",

            palette = "npg",
            notch = FALSE,
            add = "jitter",
            repel = TRUE)+
    stat_compare_means(aes(group = has_c4),
                       label = "p.signif", 
                       method = "t.test")+
    theme(legend.position = "top",
          legend.text = element_text(face = "italic"),
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1,vjust = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(0.1, 0))

}, cols, y_labels)
```


## Weed growth

In this figure, why using 25% or 50% Axial have less total weed density when compare with 75% or 100% Axial? Similar results were also found in B and C.

```{r}
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = my_plots[c(1,3,5)],
                   labels = "AUTO",
                   ncol = 2)
```


## Weed bioactivity (respiration and photosynthesis)

Are these parameters come from weed plant?

```{r}
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = my_plots[c(4,6:9)],
                   labels = "AUTO")
```


# The growth of wheat infested by weed

Could you explain the setting of weed free control in this data frame?

```{r}
infested_wheat
```

## ANOVA analysis

```{r}
compare_means(shoot_length~treatments,data = infested_wheat,method = "anova")
compare_means(SPAD_value~treatments,data = infested_wheat,method = "anova")
compare_means(no_of_tillers_per_plant~treatments,data = infested_wheat,method = "anova")
compare_means(biological_yield~treatments,data = infested_wheat,method = "anova")

## Wheat growth

Firstly, similar questions can be raised as I did in discussing the weed_infestation results. On this basis, the conclusions are:

- The application of herbicide also have significant suppressing effect on wheat growth;
- The addition of C4 SynComs neutralize such a toxic effect.
- 75% of Axial and C4 has the best performance in maintaining wheat growth. In such condition, all the four parameters showed in this figure are comparable to the weed-free control.

```{r}
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = list_of_plots[c(1,4:6)],
                   labels = "AUTO",
                   ncol = 2)

```

## Wheat bioactivity

```{r}
cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = list_of_plots[c(2,7:9)],
                   labels = "AUTO",
                   ncol = 2)
```

# Conclusion

The main questions of this study are: 

1. Whether we can use the combination of herbicide and SynComs to achieve environment-friendly weed control?
2. If yes, how could we find the best solution, i. e. the recipe for the best? The best solution has its application value. It can be directly used to improve agricultural production.

From the data showed on the above, we now can found:

1. Yes, we can achieve a better control of weed in wheat field with both herbicide and bacteria communities. The addition of bacteria community can not only enhance the suppression effect of herbicide, but also promote the growth of wheat.

2. While combining the herbicide and bacteria community, using 75% or 50% dose of Axial and C4 is sufficient in inhibiting weed growth.
